---
The qudi-core repository represents the base installation for the `qudi` Python package.

It provides a versatile framework for modular multi-instrument and multi-computer measurement 
applications.
It enables scientists and engineers to easily develop specialized multithreaded graphical or 
non-graphical applications.

Most of the more technical details about a complex measurement suite are handled automatically by 
`qudi` so the developer can focus on what matters most... the measurement control logic and the 
optional graphical user interface.

An incomplete list of functionality `qudi` provides:
- logging
- thread management
- automatic app status dumping/loading
- runtime resource management
- base modules for hardware interfaces, measurement logics and graphical user interfaces
- inter-module communication
- support for installable `qudi` namespace package addons
- interactive local IPython kernel interface
- high-level automation framework via tasks/scripts
- measurement setup configuration via YAML config file
- various tooling as a Python library
- basic data storage facility
- ...

## Attribution
If you are publishing any work based on using qudi as a framework/tool it is good practice to 
mention the qudi project, e.g. in the methods description.

Even better, you could simply cite our initial publication about qudi:\
[Qudi: A modular python suite for experiment control and data processing](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2017.02.001)

The qudi contributors will appreciate this and it helps our open-source community to gain attention.
This will hopefully attract more people willing to help in improving the qudi project which in turn 
benefits everyone using this software. 

Thank you!
