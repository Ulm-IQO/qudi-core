.. _logging:

Logging
=======

Qudi uses the ``logging`` module from the Python standard library to
manage log messages. Please refer to the `official Python
documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html>`__ to get
familiar with the concept.

Running qudi will initialize the ``qudi.core.logger`` module which
configures the ``logging`` module settings and installs log handlers in
order to centrally manage all log messages.

| All log records are displayed in the qudi main window where they can
  also be filtered.
| Log messages of level “error” or higher will additionally trigger a
  modal error dialog pop-up displaying the error message and traceback.

   **⚠ WARNING:**

   Qudi additionally installs a global ``sys.excepthook`` handler to
   catch all unhandled exceptions and prevent the application from
   terminating.

   All exceptions handled that way are diverted to the qudi logging
   facility with logging level “error”.

Furthermore, all log records are written into a text file located in the
qudi subdirectory of the user home directory (OS dependent). The log
files of the last 5 qudi sessions are preserved.

Levels
------

The predefined most common logging levels are the same as described in
the ``logging`` package documentation:

========== =============
Level Name Numeric Value
========== =============
critical   50
error      40
warn       30
info       20
debug      10
========== =============

critical
~~~~~~~~

When a log record of level “critical” and higher is detected qudi will
immediately attempt to kill all running tasks and processes.

In 99.99% of the cases there should be no reason to log a record of this
level. So don’t do it unless you have very good reasons and know what
you are doing.

error
~~~~~

Records of level “error” or higher should usually only be logged while
handling an exception (see: :ref:`exception handling
guidelines <error>`).

Unhandled exceptions will automatically be logged on the “error” level.

warn
~~~~

Warning messages can be used as a tool by application programmers to
point out possible problems, e.g. an occurring edge case that is not yet
well handled and often leads to errors.

info
~~~~

Info messages should be used by an application programmer to inform the
user of major events or milestones in the intended program execution
flow.

   **⚠ WARNING:**

   | There is a fine line between spam and useful information density.
   | Think carefully what to log and use “debug” level while developing
     code and debugging.

debug
~~~~~

Use debug messages for information only interesting for programmers,
e.g. to simplify debugging. Records of this level and below are ignored
by default and are not logged unless you run qudi in debug mode (command
line argument ``--debug``).

Usage
-----

The usual way to create a log record is to get a ``logging.Logger``
instance and call the level names on it with the desired log message as
argument, i.e.:

.. code:: python

   <logger>.debug('my debug message')
   <logger>.info('my info message')
   <logger>.warn('my warning message')
   <logger>.error('my error message')
   <logger>.critical('my critical message')

For this purpose you want to include the traceback in the log record.
You can do this easily by calling ``exception`` on the logger instance:

.. code:: python

   try:
       0/0
   except ZeroDivisionError:
       # This will include the traceback in the log record:
       <logger>.exception('There was an exception while trying to divide two numbers')

qudi Measurement Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The base class of any :ref:`qudi measurement
module <measurement_modules>` already provides you with an
appropriate ``Logger`` object that can be accessed with the ``log``
property:

.. code:: python

   from qudi.core.module import LogicBase

   class MyExampleLogic(LogicBase):
       """ Module description goes here """
       
       ...

       def add_numbers(self, x, y):
           """ Just a basic example method to add two numbers and log an info message. """
           result = x + y
           self.log.info(f'Just added two number {x} and {y} resulting in {result}')
           return result
       
       ...

Other modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For any module that is not a qudi measurement module but part of the
``qudi`` package namespace, you should use ``get_logger`` from
``qudi.core.logger`` and initialize the logger with the modules
``__name__`` attribute:

.. code:: python

   from qudi.core.logger import get_logger

   logger = get_logger(__name__)
   logger.info('Module initialized')  # create example log record

For any other Python module you can simply get a ``Logger`` object as
described in the `official Python
documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html>`__:

.. code:: python

   from logging import getLogger

   logger = getLogger(__name__)
   logger.info('Module initialized')  # create example log record
