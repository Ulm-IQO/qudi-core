## Ruff Autoformatting
To ensure a consistent code style across the project, we've included a configuration for [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff), a fast Python linter and formatter.

Before submitting a pull request, please format your code using Ruff. You can run it as a standalone tool or integrate it with your IDE for automatic formatting.

For installation and setup instructions, refer to the [official Ruff documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/).
