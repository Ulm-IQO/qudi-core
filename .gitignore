docs/_static/
>>>>>>> 25ee7046 (Got autosummary working with a custom template. There are numerous warnings during the build due to syntax etc but at least the docs render locally. Added several `__init__.py` files to enable autosummary to recurse into submodules. Also some modules were run upon import which broke the build so added `if __name__ == "__main__"` where necessary. For some reason, the widgets submodule actually causes a segfault during the sphinx build which is amazing. I removed the blank `__init__.py` to avoid sphinx recursing into that submodule so the docs can build at least.)
