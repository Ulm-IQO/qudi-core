"""
This file contains a custom .ui file loader since the current (v5.14.1) Pyside2 implementation or
qtpy implementation do not fully allow promotion to a custom widget if the custom widget is not a
direct subclass of the base widget defined in the .ui file. For example you can subclass
QDoubleSpinBox and promote this to your custom class MyDoubleSpinBox but you can not properly
subclass QAbstractSpinBox and promote QDoubleSpinBox (even though QDoubleSpinBox inherits
QAbstractSpinBox).
Funny enough it works if you use Pyside2's ui-to-py-converter and run the generated python code.
This module provides a wrapper to do just that.
